# PHP Clean Architecture
An example structure to clean architecture in PHP.

Also known as `Ports and Adapters Architecture` or `Hexagonal Architecture`.
Still in progress...


- Don't forget that this project just demonstrates folder structure of a clean architecture by borrowing concepts from layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, DDD, event sourcing etc.
- It's overkill to create a structure for such a simple project. Consider to use it only if number of use cases are more than 25.
- There is no silver bullet for it. Folder names and whole structure may be different on each project. Focus to get the general idea and create your own solution for your project.
- Trusted and community supported packages is used like Doctrine ORM.
- Main goals are separation of concerns, SOLID, decoupling high-level policies from the low-level implementation details.
